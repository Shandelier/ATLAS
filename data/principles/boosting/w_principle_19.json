First, recall the American Revolution, then identify the main author of the document.\"\n\nIn order to answer the main question, it is important to have background knowledge about the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence. The American Revolution refers to the time period in the late 18th century when the thirteen British colonies in North America fought for their independence from Great Britain. The Declaration of Independence is a document that was written in 1776, officially declaring the colonies' independence from Britain. It is a cornerstone of American democracy and outlines the fundamental principles of freedom and human rights.\n\nWith this background knowledge, we can determine that the main author of the Declaration of Independence was Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was an influential figure in American history, known for his role in drafting the Declaration and serving as the third president of the United States. His eloquent writing and commitment to individual rights made him a key contributor to the document.\n\nTo summarize, the main author of the Declaration of Independence was Thomas Jefferson. By recalling the American Revolution and identifying the key figure involved in its drafting, we can confidently answer the main question."
